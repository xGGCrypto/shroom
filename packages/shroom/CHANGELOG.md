- **BREAKING:** Tile Map Parsing behavior

  Tile map parsing is now equal to how the original tilemaps work. That means each row and column should be padded with an empty (`x`) tile. So for example:

  ```
  00
  00
  ```

  becomes

  ```
  xxx
  x00
  x00
  ```

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Figure assets dumping behavior.
